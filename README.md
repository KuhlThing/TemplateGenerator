As a manager, I want an easy way to generate a page for quick reference to my employees' information, such as email, GitHub, etc. so that I can have that information on hand.

This app prompts the user for their job, employee ID, email, and role. Different roles have different follow-up prompts, such as office number for manager, GitHub username for engineer, and school for intern. Once all questions have been answered, the app generates an html page that displays all information gathered from the prompts.

Steps:

-Open terminal and navigate to the app folder, type "npm install", and follow the prompts.



After all questions have been answered, the app generates an html page that should open in the user's browser automatically.
